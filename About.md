<h3>1. <strong> I will cause no harm to my human</strong> </h3>
Robocytes encode the genetic code of their host they are encrypted to self destruct if ever programmed to kill the blood cells of the host.
<h3>2. <strong> I will do no harm to myself </strong> </h3>
Robocytes perform systematic cleansing to calibrate and perform their daily task, their hardware is designed to outlast 105 years. 
<h3>3. <strong> I will do no harm to my environment </strong> </h3>
