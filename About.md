```markdown

1. **I will cause no harm to my human** 
Robocytes encode the genetic code of their host they are encrypted to self destruct if ever programmed to kill the blood cells of the host.
2. **I will do no harm to myself** 
Robocytes perform systematic cleansing to calibrate and perform their daily task, their hardware is designed to outlast 105 years. 
3. **I will do no harm to my environment**
These microscopic robots leave no traces in the human body , when dormant they circulate through the body like blood cells.
